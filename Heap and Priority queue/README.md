# **Heap and Priority Queue**

Heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal to (in a min heap) the key of C. A common implementation of a heap is the binary heap, in which the tree is a complete binary tree. A heap is a useful data structure when it is necessary to repeatedly remove the object with the highest (or lowest) priority. The most common implementation of a priority queue is the binary heap.

Priority queue is an abstract data type which is like a regular queue or stack data structure, but where additionally each element has a "priority" associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority. If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.
